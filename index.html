<p><b>According to this law, If a straight current-carrying wire is imagined to be held in the right hand, with the thumb stretched along the direction of the current, the direction of the magnetic field produced by the current is in the direction in which the fingers are curled.<br>

<h3 class="StraightW">Magnetic Field lines due to a Current in a straight conductor</h3>
<p>The magnetic field lines around a straight conductor carrying current are concentric circles on planes perpendicular to the direction of current.<br>
The direction of magnetic field due to straight current carrying wire can be obtained by 'Right Hand Thumb Rule'.</p>

<p>The magnitude of magnetic field is produced at a given point increases as the current through wire increases and decreases as the distance from it increases.</p>

<h2 align="center" style="color: #191F42;"> Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) <img src="atom.png" height="15%"> </h2>

<ol type="a"><li> <b> A current flows through a coil as long as a magnet moves near the coil, the coil moves near the magnet or both of them move. So, a current flows in the coil when there is a relative motion between the magnet and the coil.</b></li>
<li><b> While there is a relative motion between the magnet and the coil, the magnetic field around the coil keeps changing. The changing magnetic field causes the current in the coil.</b></li></ol><br>

<h1>Lenz's Law</h1>
<ul>
 <li>When the north pole of a magnet moves towards the loop, a current is induced in the loop, in such a way that it opposes the motion i.e. keeps it away from the magnet (the current is induced in anti-clockwise direction).</li>
 <li>When north pole of the magnet is moved away from the loop, a current is induced in the loop in such a way that it opposes the motion i.e. attracts the magnet towards it. The current is induced in clockwise direction in the coil).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the above example, the magnetic field associated with the coil or the number of magnetic field lines of the magnet passing through the coil is known as <b>Magnetic Flux Φ </b>. So, we can define magnetic flux as the number of magnetic lines passing through a given area. Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity. Its SI unit is Weber (Wb) and its CGS unit is Maxwell.</p>

<img src="fx.png" width="100%">
<ol type="a" start="3">
 <li><b>The direction of the current depends on whether the magnetic field is increasing or decreasing. The magnetic field around the coil increases as the coil and magnet come closer, and decreases as they move apart. That is why the currunt Blown one direction on moving the magnet towards the coil and in the opposite direction on moving the magnet away from the coil.</b></li>
</ol>
<br>
A current produced by a changing magnetic flux is called an induced current.This phenomenon is called electromagnetic induction.<br><br>
The phenomenon in which an electric current is induced in a circuit because of a changing magnetic field is called Electromagnetic Induction.

<h1 >Live, Neutral and Earth Wires</h1>
<p>The electric power lines enter our house three wires- the live wire, the neutral wire and the earth wire.</p>
<p>The live wire is at 220 volts. The ground wire is maintained at zero potential by connecting it to a large plate buried in the ground. And the neutral wire is also maintained at almost zero potential</p>
<p>By convention, red is for <font style="color: #fd291e;"> <b> live (L) </b></font>, black is for <font style="color:#808080"><b>neutral (N)</b></font> and green is for <font style="color: #06bf56;"><b> earth (E).</b></font></p>
